## Chapter 4

### Getting help

Help for a known command

`man command_name`

Searching for command names and inside docs

`apropos serach_term`

### Regular expressions

Search a file

`grep "expression" filename.ext`

Extended regular expressions

`egrep "expression" filename.txt`

Same as `grep -E ...` and for GNU `grep`, same as plain ol' `grep` according to the docs on my RHEL.

Fixed regular expressions

`fgrep "expression" filename.txt`

Capturing groups let you search for whole groups at a time, e.g.

`egrep "(iss){2}" states.txt`

searches for 2 instances of "iss" in a single state's names (matches Mississippi).

Arbitrary sets are defined in square brackets, _e.g._ `[0-9]` or `[abc]`.

Anchors are `^` for start and `$` for end.  ("First you get the power, then you get the money.")

You display line numbers with `-n` flag.  You search recursively with `-r`.
